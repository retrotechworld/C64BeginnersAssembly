; Chapter_01_border_irq.asm - documented ACME source
; Every code-bearing line has WHAT, WHY and HOW comments.
; WHAT describes the operation. WHY explains its role. HOW explains encoding,
; flags, addressing, hardware effects or control flow.
; Code comments do not change the generated program bytes.
; PURPOSE: Watch an installed system interrupt routine change the border.
; FLOW: start installs irq_routine at $0314/$0315 while IRQs are masked, then returns to
; BASIC. The existing CIA system timer calls the handler; INC changes the border and JMP $EA31
; continues normal KERNAL service.
; TRY: Change INC $D020 to a deliberate LDA #5 / STA $D020 pair to make the border stay green.
; ASSUMPTIONS: This is a CIA system-timer IRQ, not a raster IRQ. INC is an NMOS read-modify-
; write operation on an I/O register. The routine stays installed after RTS; do not load over
; it without resetting.
; ASSEMBLE: Select CBM format and an output name using the command line.
; Example from the companion root:
; acme --strict-segments -f cbm -o demo.prg chapter_programs/Chapter_01_border_irq.asm
; Archived originals are unchanged and are not the recommended teaching copies.

; WHAT / WHY / HOW documented teaching copy.
; Original files are preserved in originals/ACME_Source.
; WHAT: Select the NMOS 6510 instruction set.
; WHY: Generate instructions for the C64 CPU rather than a later 65C02.
; HOW: In ACME 0.97, 6510 aliases nmos6502 and also permits undocumented opcodes; this course
; uses official instructions.
!cpu 6510 ; Output is selected with -f cbm -o on the command line.
; WHAT: Place the following output at $0801.
; WHY: Keep the BASIC launcher, executable code or graphics at its planned address.
; HOW: This is assembly-time placement, not a runtime jump. CBM output fills gaps between the
; lowest and highest emitted addresses.
* = $0801
; WHAT: Emit 5 literal bytes.
; WHY: Create the BASIC next-line link, line number and SYS token.
; HOW: These are stored data, not CPU instructions. Binary row bits run left to right from the
; high bit of each byte; table indices start at zero.
!byte $0b,$08,$0a,$00,$9e
; WHAT: Emit the quoted text bytes.
; WHY: Supply decimal SYS digits in the BASIC launch line.
; HOW: ACME converts the string with the current text table; digits 2064 occupy four bytes. This
; is not executable text or a screen-code declaration.
!text "2064"
; WHAT: Emit 3 literal bytes.
; WHY: Terminate the BASIC line and then the BASIC program.
; HOW: These are stored data, not CPU instructions. Binary row bits run left to right from the
; high bit of each byte; table indices start at zero.
!byte 0,0,0
; WHAT: Place the following output at $0810.
; WHY: Keep the BASIC launcher, executable code or graphics at its planned address.
; HOW: This is assembly-time placement, not a runtime jump. CBM output fills gaps between the
; lowest and highest emitted addresses.
* = $0810
; WHAT: Define address label start.
; WHY: Name the entry or data location used to prepare the program before display updates begin.
; HOW: ACME records the current assembly address; a label alone emits no bytes.
start:
; WHAT: I = 1.
; WHY: Mask IRQ recognition; NMI and hardware activity continue.
; HOW: Mask IRQ recognition; NMI and hardware activity continue. Among status flags, only I
; changes.
    sei
; WHAT: Load A from <irq_routine (literal value).
; WHY: Prepare the value for KERNAL IRQ vector low byte.
; HOW: Immediate operand: the value is encoded in the instruction. Flags updated: N Z.
    lda #<irq_routine
; WHAT: Copy A to KERNAL IRQ vector low byte.
; WHY: Update KERNAL IRQ vector low byte while we prepare the program before display updates
; begin.
; HOW: Read or write the named memory address; ACME chooses its supported encoding. Status flags
; are unchanged.
    sta $0314
; WHAT: Load A from >irq_routine (literal value).
; WHY: Prepare the value for KERNAL IRQ vector high byte.
; HOW: Immediate operand: the value is encoded in the instruction. Flags updated: N Z.
    lda #>irq_routine
; WHAT: Copy A to KERNAL IRQ vector high byte.
; WHY: Update KERNAL IRQ vector high byte while we prepare the program before display updates
; begin.
; HOW: Read or write the named memory address; ACME chooses its supported encoding. Status flags
; are unchanged.
    sta $0315
; WHAT: I = 0.
; WHY: Permit maskable IRQ recognition; does not clear interrupt sources.
; HOW: Permit maskable IRQ recognition; does not clear interrupt sources. Among status flags,
; only I change.
    cli
; WHAT: Return from the current subroutine.
; WHY: Return control to the caller after this routine has completed its work.
; HOW: Pull the JSR return address, add one, and continue there. The stack must still match the
; call; flags are unchanged.
    rts
; WHAT: Define address label irq_routine.
; WHY: Name the entry or data location used to handle the system or raster interrupt before
; KERNAL continuation.
; HOW: ACME records the current assembly address; a label alone emits no bytes.
irq_routine:
; WHAT: Increment border colour modulo 256.
; WHY: Advance the counter, position or offset used to handle the system or raster interrupt
; before KERNAL continuation.
; HOW: Read or write the named memory address; ACME chooses its supported encoding. Flags
; updated: N Z. NMOS memory read-modify-write writes the old byte before the new one; avoid
; applying this blindly to I/O.
    inc $d020
; WHAT: Continue execution at $ea31.
; WHY: Continue standard KERNAL IRQ service after balancing this handler extra saves.
; HOW: Absolute JMP changes PC without stacking a return address; flags are unchanged. Standard
; ROM service ultimately restores the ROM-saved registers and returns with RTI; this internal
; address depends on the C64 ROM.
